Minecraft Overviewer: World Border
=======================

The [Bukkit WorldBorder plugin](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/worldborder/) allows defining a circular, rectangular or elliptical world boundary region beyond which players are not able to walk.

As this boundary generally lies well within the range of pre-generated terrain, an [Overviewer](http://overviewer.org/) map may show features that turn out to be inaccessible to the disappointment of explorers.

This script is intended to draw the boundary onto the map as an overlay, clearly marking the accessible area.

This is a prototype that currently functions as a purely client-side user script with hard-coded values for the boundary size and shape. It may eventually become a full Minecraft Overviewer plugin on the server side.
